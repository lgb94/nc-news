# NC NEWS SITE - Lewis Brown edition

Hello again!

Hosted site link: https://stirring-nasturtium-588187.netlify.app/

This is what the website should look like from this repository - all built from scratch using React.

The website pulls its information from an API I set up for a back-end project, the repository for which can be found here: https://github.com/lgb94/be-nc-news


# INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

You want to play around with the site? Say no more chief. 

1. Clone and fork the repository - you know the deal
2. run 'npm install' to install the projects required dependencies
3. npm run dev to host the site locally (your link should appear in the terminal)
    - to see the sites full functionality, sign in to a username (you can find them as authors of the 'articles' and 'comments') on the users page. I used jessjelly during development ;)

Have fun!
